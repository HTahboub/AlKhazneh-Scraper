This is an old (2019?) abandoned project from a while back that was supposed to find everyone in my school's ID on our website (alkhazneh.kingsacademy.edu.jo) with the eventual goal of making a website that lets you see your class network, but at the end I found out that it's not possible to get the ID of someone with whom you share no classes (or isn't a teacher/staff), so I had to call it quits.
